# tempSensorArduino
This is a simple Arduino Project using a temperature sensor and LEDs to indicate temperature ranges.
In this project I made use of Temperature Sesnsor (TMP36), two LED lights and an Arduino UNO board using the  TICKERCAD simulator. I have two LEDs, red and blue so the Red Led will be on for temperature in a specified range (for hotter temperaures) and the blue Led will be on for temperatures in its specified range (for cooler temperatures.
